# FUNCTIONS
 A block of code that is reusable and performs a particular task. these may take 0 or more inputs and may as well return one or more outputs
Functions are defined in four different types
*Built-in functions
*Recursive functions
*Defined functions
*Lambda functions
### Built-in functions. come built in with the python language used without need for additional code.
*example*
print(), min(), max(), math(), sorted(), bool(), abs() etc
### Recursive functions. these call themselves to perform a task repeatedly untill a condition is met.
### Defined functions. these are user defined programms executing or performing specific tasks as desired by the user,
### Lambda functions. they are small anonymous functions that can be defined in a single line normally used for quick, simple operations that do not require a full function definition.
